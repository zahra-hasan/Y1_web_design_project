# web_design_project
This is a web design project for web and technology course that was written using HTML and CSS.
# The Project objective
The project objective was to implement a website about myself and the degree I’m studying using mobile first responsive web design.		
# The development process
The final product took me almost two weeks to complete and the process was:
1- reading the assignment instructions and marking criteria carefully before coding.
2- start writing the planning and design document.
3- start implementing basic index.html (home page) first.
4- implement the rest of the pages separately.
5- implement a menu according to the planning document and connect pages.
6- add pictures and navigation features.
7- work on javascripted parts finally because at the time they were the hardest.
8- Write a development and testing document.
# The final result
The end result website was working and met most of the requirements. I was very happy with the product I made in such a short time and also the good feedback I received from my professor. 
# What I have learned
I have discovered my passion for web development using (HTML-CSS) as it allowed me to transform my artistic skills into the computer science world which I didn’t know about before starting my degree. Moreover, I strengthened my self-learning skills as I started learning (HTML-CSS) by myself from zero using open resources and Youtube.
